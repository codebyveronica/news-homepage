## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned a lot about CSS Grid. The practice is really very different from theory, and I confess that I struggled a lot to reach the proposed result. But it was a really good challenge, and an even better way to learn more about CSS Grid and test my knowledge. Challenges like this are great and I always learn a lot from them.

### Continued development

Now, having realized how tricky CSS Grid can be, I intend to continue creating projects that use it. It's great for building websites, and I definitely need and will master it.
